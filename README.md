# App Chat

## Description
This project implements a real-time chat, in which the user can chat with 
at least one person at a time. You can choose a username to appear when 
sending a message, and otherwise it will appear anonymous. In addition 
to text, you can send images. The chat also implements a tic-tac-toe game 
to play against other users.
